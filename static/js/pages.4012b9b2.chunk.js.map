of foreign direct\n                    investment in Pakistan. In 2018 expats have sent more than\n                    11.8 Billion USD as remittance in Pakistan in the first 7\n                    months. A major portion of this investment is being used to\n                    buy property in Pakistan. Millions of Pakistanis are spread\n                    all around the globe to find a better living for themselves\n                    and their families. However, at the end of the day they want\n                    to invest in Pakistan to secure a home for themselves and\n                    their children. Today we need a comprehensive Expats Guide\n                    to Investment in Pakistan Property at Government level.\n                    Unfortunately we do not have any plans or policies at the\n                    national level to provide these Expats with safe and secure\n                    real estate investments. However the public sector has\n                    identified this and we can now see dozens of opportunities\n                    available to Expats for investment ranging from residential\n                    and commercial plots to agriculture and raw land. The public\n                    real estate sector is not regulated in Pakistan and\n                    therefore a huge number of projects fail every year and a\n                    lot of people lose their heard earned money. Besides this,\n                    there are a lot of fraudulent societies who try to rip off\n                    people and due to a weak law and order situation, it is too\n                    easy for them to get away with this.\n                  </p>\n                </Card>\n              </Col>\n              <Col sm={6}>\n                <img\n                  style={{\n                    width: '100%',\n                    height: '100%',\n                  }}\n                  src={property}\n                  alt=\"property\"\n                />\n              </Col>\n            </Row>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Separator className=\"mb-5\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <Row style={{ width: '100%' }}>\n              <Col sm={6}>\n                <img\n                  style={{\n                    width: '100%',\n                    height: '100%',\n                  }}\n                  src={car}\n                  alt=\"property\"\n                />\n              </Col>\n              <Col sm={6}>\n                <Card\n                  className=\"mb-4\"\n                  style={{\n                    height: '100%',\n                    padding: '30px',\n                  }}\n                >\n                  <h2>\n                    Investing In Cars Is More Profitable Than Fixed Deposits\n                  </h2>\n                  <br />\n                  <p>\n                    The most important question for any Pakistani who is looking\n                    to make profits out of their savings is, “What should I do\n                    with my money?” Majority of the people just opt for fixed\n                    deposits because of their consistent yields for a longer\n                    period of time and lack of over-complicated predictions,\n                    which means majority of the people don’t realize the\n                    potential of investment in automobiles in Pakistan. So, this\n                    blog entry is aimed towards comparing the profits yielded by\n                    investing the same amount of money in the same timeframe in\n                    fixed deposits and automobiles, as this will give the much\n                    needed insight into the profit margins of both.

But if the added thickness is a\n                  problem or the existing tile isn't well attached, then that\n                  old layer should be removed. In small areas that are only a\n                  few feet square, a hammer and a cold chisel will do the\n                  job—eventually. On bigger jobs, a tool known as a demolition\n                  hammer is a better bet. With a cold-chisel bit chucked in its\n                  jaws, this miniature electric jackhammer delivers about 1,000\n                  strikes per minute, working far faster than any would-be John\n                  Henry could pound by hand. The hammering action starts only\n                  when the chisel tip is pushed against a hard surface, so the\n                  operator remains in full control, with minimal fatigue. You\n                  can rent one of these tools (and chisels) for about $70 a day.\n                  In most cases, you won't even need it for that long.\n                </Card>\n

Brick Defined Officially, the term brick is used to denote a building unit made of shaped clay, but in modern times it is used to refer to any stone- or clay-based building unit that is joined with cementitious mortar when used in construction. Typically, bricks are about 4 wide, 8 inches long, with a variety of thicknesses.

The reinforcing steel—rods, bars, or mesh—absorbs the tensile, shear, and sometimes the compressive stresses in a concrete structure. Plain concrete does not easily withstand tensile and shear stresses caused by wind, earthquakes, vibrations, and other forces and is therefore unsuitable in most structural applications. In reinforced concrete, the tensile strength of steel and the compressive strength of concrete work together to allow the member to sustain these stresses over considerable spans. The invention of reinforced concrete in the 19th century revolutionized the construction industry, and concrete became one of the world’s most common building materials.'\n  );\n  const [sandDescription, setSandDescription] = useState(\n    'Plastering Sand is a very fine grade of sand.
